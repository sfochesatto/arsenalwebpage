		<h2>HISTORIC 2003-04 SEASON</h2>

		<p align="justify">The 2003–04 season was the 106th in the history of Arsenal Football Club. It began on 1 July 2003 and concluded on 30 June 2004, with competitive matches played between August and May. The club ended the <a href="https://youtu.be/ofrTchks6T0" target="blank">Premier League</a> campaign as champions without a single defeat – a record of 26 wins and 12 draws.</p>
		
		<p align="justify">Arsenal's top goalscorer for the third year running was <a href="https://youtu.be/a_cwjfbgWpI" target
		="blank">Thierry Henry</a>, who scored 39 goals in 51 games. The Frenchman was given the accolade of PFA Players' Player of the Year by his fellow peers and the FWA Footballer of the Year by football writers. Although the Arsenal team were unsuccessful in cup competitions, their dominance in the league was regarded by many commentators as a standalone achievement.</p>
		
		<p align="justify">They acquired the nickname <a href="https://youtu.be/kl6qoK9W1es" target="blank">"The Invincibles"</a>, much like the Preston North End team that went unbeaten in the inaugural Football League season. The club was awarded a golden replica trophy by the Premier League once the season concluded and they remained unbeaten for 49 games, setting a new record. In 2012, the Arsenal team of 2003–04 won the "Best Team" category in the Premier League 20 Seasons Awards.</p>
